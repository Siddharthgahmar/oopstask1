    "Ans-In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data and behavior that all objects of that class will share. An object is an instance of a class. It has its own unique data and behavior, which is defined by the class.\n",

    "A suitable example of a class is a car. A car class would define the data and behavior that all cars share, such as the number of wheels, the type of engine, and the ability to drive. An object of the car class would be a specific car, such as a Toyota Camry or a Ford Mustang. This car object would have its own unique data, such as its license plate number and its current location. It would also have its own unique behavior, such as its current speed and its current direction."
