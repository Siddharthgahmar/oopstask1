    "Ans-Abstraction is one of the four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP). It is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from its users. This allows users to focus on the object's functionality without having to worry about how it works.\n",

    "There are two types of abstraction in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction: This hides the data members of an object from its users. Only the methods of the object can access the data members.\n",
    "Method abstraction: This hides the implementation of a method from its users. Only the method's signature is visible to users.\n",
    "An example of data abstraction is a Car object. The Car object has many data members, such as the engine, the wheels, and the body. However, users of the Car object do not need to know about these data members. They can simply use the Car object's methods, such as start(), stop(), and drive()"

    "Abstraction is a way of hiding the complexity of a system by providing a simpler interface for users to interact with. For example, a car is a complex system with many moving parts, but users of a car do not need to know about all of these details in order to drive it. Instead, they can interact with the car through a simple interface, such as the steering wheel, pedals, and buttons.\n",

    "Encapsulation is a way of hiding the data within a class from users of that class. This is done by declaring the data as private, which means that it can only be accessed by methods within the class. Encapsulation allows developers to control how data is used, which can help to prevent errors and improve code readability"
